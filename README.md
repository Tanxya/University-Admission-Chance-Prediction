# Predicting University Admission Chances

## Overview
This project is a system to predict university admission chances based on student profiles using classification algorithms. The project also features a user-friendly interface developed with Streamlit, enabling students to estimate their likelihood of admission interactively.

## Features
- Predicts the probability of admission to a university.
- Includes models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- Random Forest is the primary model used, as it outperformed other algorithms in accuracy.
- Displays feature importance to help understand which factors influence admission chances.
- Provides a simple and intuitive web application interface built with Streamlit.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Standardized test scores (e.g., GRE, TOEFL)
- Academic performance (e.g., CGPA)
- University rating
- Research experience
- Personal statements
- Demographic information

## Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/university-admission-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd university-admission-prediction
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage
1. Enter your academic and profile details in the web interface.
2. Click the "Predict" button to view your admission chances.
3. If the prediction is negative, a "Better luck next time" message will appear.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application file.
- `models/`: Contains code for training and testing classification models.
- `data/`: Stores the dataset used for the project.
- `results/`: Includes evaluation metrics and visualizations.

## Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest (primary model)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine

## Highlights
- Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy among all tested models.
- User-friendly UI built with Streamlit.
